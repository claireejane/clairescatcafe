  TINY QUESTERS  —  Free NPC Pack (2 Villagers)
  2 top-down pixel-art town & village NPCs from
  "Tiny Questers — Complete Pixel RPG Asset Pack" by Bobddadoo
  (https://bobddadoo.itch.io)
================================================================

Thanks for downloading! This free pack brings your towns and
villages to life with 2 fully-animated villagers, each with idle
and walk animations in all 4 directions. Use them in your
personal and commercial games, free of charge.

      THE 2 VILLAGERS
        Village Man  ·  Female Villager

These NPCs share the same 64 x 64 size and feet-center pivot as
the Tiny Questers hero classes (Warrior, Mage, ...), so heroes
and townsfolk drop into the same animator setup and line up on
the same tile grid.

Like these two? The full "Tiny Questers — 8 NPC Pack" adds a
Blacksmith, Guard, Old Man, Town Girl, Merchant and Barmaid
(plus bonus shop signs & icons) on the same itch.io page.

Follow Bobddadoo on itch.io to be notified when more NPCs and
hero classes drop, and to get launch-week discounts.


----------------------------------------------------------------
  WHAT'S INSIDE  (2 NPCs x 6 clips = 12 animation clips)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Every NPC ships the same 6 clips (64 x 64, shared feet-center
  pivot):
    idle   — down / up (back view)
    walk   — down / up (back view) / left / right

  Each clip is provided as: individual PNG frames (single/),
  a horizontal sprite sheet (atlas/), POT-padded copies of both
  (single_pot/, atlas_pot/), and preview GIFs at 1x and 5x.

----------------------------------------------------------------
  ANIMATION FRAMES  (per NPC: Idle Down / Up, Walk Down / Up / Left / Right)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Village Man ....... 5 / 4 / 4 / 4 / 6 / 6
  Female Villager ... 5 / 4 / 4 / 4 / 4 / 4

  All frames use a consistent 64 x 64 size and a shared pivot
  (feet center), so every NPC stands on the same ground line and
  you can swap clips at runtime without the sprite shifting.
  Left and Right are both hand-drawn (not mirrored), so each
  facing reads naturally.

  Up (idle_up / walk_up) is the back view — the NPC seen from
  behind, walking away from the camera.

  Both individual frames (png/single/) and horizontal sprite
  sheets (png/atlas/) are included — pick whichever your engine
  prefers. Power-of-two padded copies are in png/single_pot/
  and png/atlas_pot/ for engines / GPUs that require POT
  textures. The original art sits at top-left (0,0) with
  transparent padding on the right/bottom, so per-frame pixel
  sizes and the pivot are identical to the non-POT versions.

  Engine-agnostic — works in Unity, Godot, GameMaker, Construct,
  RPG Maker, and more.


----------------------------------------------------------------
  HOW TO USE
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Unity:
    1. Drop png/single/ or png/atlas/ into Assets/.
    2. Set Texture Type = Sprite (2D and UI).
    3. Set Filter Mode = Point (no filter) and Compression = None
       to keep the pixel-art look crisp.
    4a. Single frames: select all PNGs of one clip (e.g. one
        npc's walk_down/) and drag into the scene to auto-create
        an Animation clip.
    4b. Atlas: set Sprite Mode = Multiple, open Sprite Editor,
        Slice -> Grid By Cell Size, 64 x 64. For atlas_pot/ use
        the SAME 64 px/frame — extra empty cells at the right
        edge are transparent and can be left unused or deleted.

  Godot:
    1. Import png/single/ (or atlas/) into your project.
    2. In the Import dock set Filter = Off and Mipmaps = Off.
    3. Use AnimatedSprite2D / AnimationPlayer — single frames as
       separate textures, or atlas via AtlasTexture / Region.

  General:
    - Loop every clip: idle_*, walk_* are all seamless loops.
    - 4-direction movement: drive walk_down / up / left / right
      from the move vector, fall back to the matching idle_* when
      the NPC stops.
    - Timing: ~6.67 fps matches the preview GIFs.
